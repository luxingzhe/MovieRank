## Assumptions and Clarification

1. React as frontend and Node as backend, both projects are put inside one folder.
2. only one page of movie data is pulled down to demonstrate the functionality
3. in backend, the local object is used to track the click statistics. if the backend restarts, the data will not persist
4. tests, styles and code optimizations (api urls are hard-coded, better page design can be used, etc) are not done in current development due to time limitation
5. i assume the testing environment has the required dependencies to run the code, e.g. node, npm ,etc
6. frontend is served in port 3000 by default and backend is served in port 3100. i assume those ports are available.

## How to run my app

1. naviate to the root directory
2. run "npm install"
3. run "npm build" if necessary
4. run "npm run frontend"
5. in a different terminal, run "npm run backend"
